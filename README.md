This is a task assignment I did for a recruitment process, the app is very simple so I kept it simple.

BLoC was used for State Management and I've used the Clean Architecture principles on the project.

Important notes:
- You may see String literals or value literals in paddings, sizes, etc.. but rest assured, because in a real-world app I do not write hardcoded Strings or Values.
- You may also see build methods instead of Flutter Widgets in some places inside the app but in the most cases(if not all) I am extracting the Flutter Widget from the build method for better performance.
- This app does not include tests or dependency injection.
